// We need to add certain tags to the HTML to get user input

// Get input from HTML file into JS file - linking JS and HTML together

// Put the rules of FizzBuzz in our JS file
// If input is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'
// If input is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'
// If input is divisible by 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'


// Have someone test our code - play our game!
